# Ontario Agri-food research centre schema library

The Ontario agri-food research centre schema library contains data schemas that help users understand data. Schemas document the details of each attribute or variable within a schema. Once you have downloaded the .zip version of the schema you can use it at the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org) to create a Data Entry Excel sheet based on this schema, or enter your data and verify it against the rules of a schema.

Ontario’s agri-food research centres are owned by the Agricultural Research Institute of Ontario (ARIO) – an agency of the Government of Ontario – and managed by the University of Guelph through the Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance.  Data from Ontario’s agri-food research centres have been generated using financial and infrastructure resources from ARIO and the Government of Ontario, which must be acknowledged in any products generated using these data.  For all products (research papers, software, conference abstracts and presentations, etc.) developed using data from Ontario’s agri-food research centres, you must include the following acknowledgement: This [title of project] was developed in part using (meta)data from [y = research centre], which is owned by the Agricultural Research Institute of Ontario and managed by the University of Guelph through the Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance.
Although data from Ontario’s agri-food research centres are generated from provincial support, the Government of Ontario does not provide any warranty of any kind regarding the accuracy, completeness, security or reliability of the data.
