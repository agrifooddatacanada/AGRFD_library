# Agri-food research centre schema library

The agri-food research centre schema library contains data schemas that help users understand data. Schemas document the details of each attribute or variable within a schema. Once you have downloaded the .zip version of the schema you can use it at the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org) to create a Data Entry Excel sheet based on this schema, or enter your data and verify it against the rules of a schema.
